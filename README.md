## Contributing

This tool has been entirely created by ChatGPT. I, @trnstlntk, am not a coder and have only developed this as a test. I am not planning to respond to requests to improve the code myself. But if others want to chime in, they are welcome. Forking this and replacing it with a human-written version would be welcome too; I have absolutely no feelings of ownership around this (but would appreciate receiving credits for the idea behind it).
